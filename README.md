__Part 1: CLASSES & METHODS__

__Part 2: CLASS VARIABLES VS INSTANCE VARAIBLES__

Skipped __part 5__ of the series as he was discussing __repr__ and __str__ which did not seem relevant at the time and was fairly niche, but will come back in the future to code this, link to part 5 :

Skipped __part 6__ of the series as he was discussing Property decorators: getters, setters and deleters,  which did not seem relevant at the time and was fairly niche, but will come back in the future to code this, link to part 6 : https://youtu.be/jCzT9XFZ5bw

__QUANTCONNECT: Understandign how quantconnect OOP was set up with inheritance, nested functions, attributes set up on intalization etc__
